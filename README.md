This Repository is about how to auto  Resizing cell with UITableviewcell, UICollectionviewcell.

-Leading space to container margin
 Now, container margin means the boundary of the parent view and leading space to it means the space between the left boundary of parent view to the left boundary of your view.

-Trailing space to container margin
 This constraint means space between the right boundary of your view to the right boundary of parent view.

-Vertical spacing to top layout guide
 This constraint means space from top of your view to the top layout guide of parent view. Now top layout guide is a margin that parent view takes up by default which is 20 points in height. These 20 points are taken so that your view does not overlap the status bar.

-Vertical spacing to bottom layout guide
 This time though bottom layout guide is the actual bottom of the view controller, since there is no need to leave the space hence this constraint means space between bottom boundary of your view to the bottom boundary of view controller.
